# harvard_cs50p_problem_sets_and_final_project

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and the final project of Harvard University's CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python online course.

## About the course: CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python
Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. [official CS50P website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)
